At the start, the group only had a handful of members, and when I held the first official group event, only one other person showed up! But even having that one person come to the event made me incredibly happy. On the day of the event, I was super nervous, and I kept wondering “Would anyone really come all the way out to this bar in Ikebukuro?” Even today, I still remember how anxious I felt! But once she finally arrived, I was absolutely ecstatic.",
